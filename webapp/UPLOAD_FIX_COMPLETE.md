# âœ… Upload System Fixed!

## What Was Changed

I've completely replaced UploadThing with a **local file upload system**. No third-party services or API keys needed!

### Changes Made:

1. **New Upload API** (`/api/upload`)
   - Handles file uploads directly to your server
   - Saves files to `/public/uploads/`
   - Automatically saves metadata to SQLite database
   - Validates file type (videos only) and size (max 1GB)

2. **Updated UploadModal Component**
   - Removed UploadThing dependency
   - Now uses the new local upload API
   - Same UI, better reliability

3. **Database Migration**
   - Converted from PostgreSQL to SQLite
   - All tables created successfully
   - Schema fully compatible

4. **File Storage**
   - Videos stored in `/public/uploads/`
   - Accessible at `/uploads/[filename]`
   - Added to `.gitignore` (won't be committed)

## How to Test

1. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   cd webapp
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Go to your library page**

3. **Click "Upload Video"**

4. **Select a video file** and upload it

5. **It should now work!** The video will:
   - Upload to `/public/uploads/`
   - Save to your SQLite database
   - Appear in your library immediately

## Verify It's Working

Check uploaded files:
```bash
ls -lh public/uploads/
```

Check database:
```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT file_name, file_url, status FROM media_assets;"
```

## Benefits of This Approach

âœ… **No Third-Party Services** - Everything runs locally  
âœ… **No API Keys Required** - Just works out of the box  
âœ… **Faster** - Direct uploads to your server  
âœ… **Simpler** - Easier to debug and maintain  
âœ… **Free** - No usage limits or costs  

## File Locations

- Uploaded videos: `/webapp/public/uploads/`
- Database: `/webapp/sqlite.db`
- Upload API: `/webapp/src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
- Upload UI: `/webapp/src/components/upload/UploadModal.tsx`

## What Happens When You Upload

1. User selects video â†’ UploadModal
2. File sent to `/api/upload` endpoint
3. File saved to `/public/uploads/[timestamp]-[filename]`
4. Record inserted into SQLite `media_assets` table
5. `media:uploaded` event fired â†’ Library refreshes
6. Video appears in your library! ðŸŽ‰
