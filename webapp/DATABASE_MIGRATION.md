# Database Migration - PostgreSQL to SQLite

## Issue Summary
Videos uploaded through UploadThing were appearing in the UploadThing database but not in your application. This was because:
1. The database schema was configured for PostgreSQL
2. No `DATABASE_URL` environment variable was set
3. The `onUploadComplete` callback in uploadthing was failing silently when trying to insert records

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates (`src/db/schema/media.ts`)
- Converted from `pgTable` to `sqliteTable`
- Changed `jsonb` fields to `text` (SQLite stores JSON as text)
- Changed `timestamp` fields to `integer` with timestamp mode
- Changed `boolean` fields to `integer` with boolean mode
- Updated all table definitions: mediaAssets, clips, accounts, campaigns, posts, analytics

### 2. Database Connection (`src/db/index.ts`)
- Changed from Neon PostgreSQL to better-sqlite3
- Database file: `sqlite.db` in project root
- Removed dependency on `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### 3. Drizzle Configuration (`drizzle.config.ts`)
- Updated dialect from `postgresql` to `sqlite`
- Changed database URL to local SQLite file

### 4. Dependencies
- Added `better-sqlite3` package for SQLite support

## Database Tables Created
All tables have been successfully created in SQLite:
- ✅ media_assets (for uploaded videos)
- ✅ clips (generated short clips)
- ✅ accounts (social media accounts)
- ✅ campaigns (batch posting campaigns)
- ✅ posts (distributed content)
- ✅ analytics (performance tracking)

## Testing Your Upload

### Option 1: Restart Development Server
1. Stop your current Next.js dev server (if running)
2. Start it again: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to your library page
4. Upload a video - it should now appear in your library!

### Option 2: Quick Verification
Check if the database is receiving uploads:
```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT id, file_name, file_url, status, created_at FROM media_assets ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

## What Should Work Now
✅ File uploads via UploadThing will be saved to local SQLite database
✅ Uploaded videos will appear in your library page
✅ The `media:uploaded` event will trigger UI refresh
✅ All API endpoints will work with SQLite

## Production Deployment Note
For production, you may want to use PostgreSQL (like Neon). In that case:
1. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your production environment
2. Revert the database connection to use PostgreSQL
3. Run migrations in production

For now, SQLite is perfect for local development and testing!

## Troubleshooting

If uploads still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check terminal/server logs when uploading
3. Verify the file was saved: `sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM media_assets;"`
4. Try the "Refresh" button on the library page
