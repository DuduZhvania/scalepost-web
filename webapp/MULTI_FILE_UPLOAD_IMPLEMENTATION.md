# Multi-File Upload Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive multi-file upload system implemented in the Scalepost application. The system supports uploading up to 20 video files simultaneously with advanced features like per-file state management, progress tracking, cancel/retry functionality, and concurrent upload control.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Upload Route Capacity
**File**: `webapp/src/app/api/uploadthing/core.ts`

- ✅ **maxFileCount**: 20 files per batch
- ✅ **maxFileSize**: 2GB per file (increased from 1GB)
- ✅ **MIME type validation**: Only video files (mp4, mov, mkv, webm)
- ✅ **Server-side validation**: Validates file types in middleware
- ✅ **Metadata return**: Returns url, name, size, type to client
- ✅ **Client-side DB handling**: DB inserts handled on client for better error handling

### 2. File Picker & Drag-and-Drop
**File**: `webapp/src/components/upload/UploadModal.tsx`

- ✅ **Multi-select**: System file picker allows selecting multiple files
- ✅ **Drag-and-drop**: Supports dropping multiple files at once
- ✅ **Validation**: Real-time validation for file type, size, and count
- ✅ **Inline errors**: Clear error messages displayed per file
- ✅ **File count limit**: Shows "X/20" files and prevents exceeding limit
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: Drag state with hover effects

### 3. Queue & Per-File State Management

**State Machine**: Each file progresses through:
```
queued → uploading → uploaded | failed | canceled
```

**QueuedFile Interface**:
```typescript
{
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  file: File;              // Original File object
  status: FileStatus;      // Current state
  progress: number;        // 0-100%
  error?: string;          // Upload error message
  uploadedUrl?: string;    // UploadThing URL
  dbSaved?: boolean;       // Database save status
  dbError?: string;        // Database error message
  cancelFn?: () => void;   // Cancel function
}
```

### 4. Progress UI

- ✅ **Overall batch progress**: Shows aggregate progress with visual bar
- ✅ **Per-file progress**: Individual progress bars (0-100%)
- ✅ **File metadata display**: Name, size in MB, type icon
- ✅ **Status indicators**: 
  - Queued: Clock icon
  - Uploading: Spinning loader + blue progress bar
  - Uploaded: Green checkmark + success message
  - Failed: Red X + error message
  - Canceled: Gray X + canceled message
- ✅ **Batch status**: "X of Y completed" counter

### 5. Concurrent Upload Control

- ✅ **Max 3 simultaneous uploads**: Prevents throttling and UI blocking
- ✅ **Automatic queue processing**: Starts next file when slot opens
- ✅ **Reference-based tracking**: Uses `activeUploadsRef` for accurate count
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: UI remains responsive during uploads

### 6. Cancel & Retry Functionality

**Cancel**:
- ✅ Cancel individual files during upload
- ✅ Remove files from queue (queued, failed, canceled states)
- ✅ Proper cleanup of upload processes

**Retry**:
- ✅ Retry failed uploads (full file re-upload)
- ✅ Retry DB saves (if upload succeeded but DB save failed)
- ✅ Separate error states for upload vs. DB failures
- ✅ Visual retry button with rotation icon

### 7. Database Integration

**File**: `webapp/src/app/api/media-assets/route.ts`

- ✅ **Per-file DB writes**: Creates row after each successful upload
- ✅ **UploadThing URL detection**: Detects and handles UploadThing files
- ✅ **Error separation**: Distinguishes upload errors from DB errors
- ✅ **Retry support**: Allows retrying DB save without re-uploading
- ✅ **Metadata storage**: Saves url, fileName, fileSize, type, status

**Database Fields**:
```typescript
{
  id: UUID
  userId: "anon"
  fileName: string
  fileUrl: string (UploadThing URL)
  fileSize: number | null
  type: "file" | "link"
  sourceUrl: null
  status: "uploaded"
}
```

### 8. Error Handling

**Validation Errors** (shown inline):
- File type not supported (only MP4, MOV, MKV, WEBM)
- File size exceeds 2GB
- Too many files (max 20)
- Empty file

**Upload Errors**:
- Network failures
- UploadThing service errors
- Timeout errors
- User cancellation

**Database Errors**:
- DB connection failures
- Insert failures
- Shown separately with yellow warning
- Allow retry without re-upload

### 9. Limits & Safeguards

- ✅ **Hard cap display**: "Up to 20 videos • Max 2GB each" in header
- ✅ **Upload button disabled**: When queue is empty or contains only invalid files
- ✅ **Close confirmation**: Prompts user if uploads are in progress
- ✅ **Cancel on close**: Cancels all active uploads if user confirms
- ✅ **File validation**: Prevents invalid files from starting upload
- ✅ **Progress preservation**: Failed files remain in queue for retry

### 10. Events & Callbacks

**File**: `webapp/src/app/(dashboard)/library/page.tsx`

**Events Dispatched**:
```typescript
// After each successful file upload + DB save
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('media:uploaded', { detail }));

// After entire batch completes
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('media:batch-complete'));
```

**Library Page Listeners**:
- ✅ Listens to `media:uploaded` - refreshes list silently after each file
- ✅ Listens to `media:batch-complete` - final refresh after batch
- ✅ Updates both "All" and current tab
- ✅ Seamless UI updates without page reload

### 11. Accessibility & Performance

**Accessibility**:
- ✅ **Keyboard operable**: Tab to navigate, Enter to activate
- ✅ **ARIA labels**: All buttons have aria-label attributes
- ✅ **Focus management**: Proper focus states on interactive elements
- ✅ **Screen reader friendly**: Semantic HTML and descriptive text

**Performance**:
- ✅ **Non-blocking uploads**: Uses concurrent control (max 3)
- ✅ **Optimized re-renders**: Uses React.memo and useCallback where appropriate
- ✅ **Reference-based tracking**: Avoids unnecessary state updates
- ✅ **Progress simulation**: Smooth progress updates without blocking
- ✅ **Responsive UI**: Remains interactive during large uploads

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
UploadModal (main component)
├── File Tab
│   ├── Drop Zone (when queue is empty)
│   ├── File Queue
│   │   ├── Overall Progress Bar
│   │   └── FileQueueItem (per file)
│   │       ├── Status Icon
│   │       ├── File Info (name, size)
│   │       ├── Progress Bar
│   │       └── Actions (cancel, retry, remove)
│   ├── Add More Button
│   └── Start Upload / Done Button
└── URL Tab (existing functionality preserved)
```

### State Management
```typescript
const [fileQueue, setFileQueue] = useState<QueuedFile[]>([]);
const activeUploadsRef = useRef(0);
const uploadQueueRef = useRef<QueuedFile[]>([]);
```

### Upload Flow
```
1. User selects/drops files
2. Files validated and added to queue (status: queued)
3. User clicks "Start Upload"
4. Process next 3 files concurrently (status: uploading)
5. Each file:
   a. Upload to UploadThing
   b. Get uploaded URL
   c. Save to database (status: uploaded)
   d. Dispatch media:uploaded event
   e. Mark as complete
6. When slot opens, process next queued file
7. When all complete, dispatch media:batch-complete event
```

### Error Recovery
```
Upload Failed:
  └─> Show error message
      └─> User clicks Retry
          └─> Re-queue file
              └─> Re-upload from start

Upload Succeeded, DB Failed:
  └─> Show warning (file uploaded but not saved)
      └─> User clicks Retry
          └─> Skip upload, retry DB save only
              └─> Save metadata to database
```

## Files Modified

1. **webapp/src/app/api/uploadthing/core.ts**
   - Increased limits and added validation

2. **webapp/src/components/upload/UploadModal.tsx**
   - Complete rewrite with multi-file support

3. **webapp/src/hooks/useUploadModal.tsx**
   - Added useCallback for optimization

4. **webapp/src/app/api/media-assets/route.ts**
   - Added support for UploadThing file metadata

5. **webapp/src/app/(dashboard)/library/page.tsx**
   - Added media:batch-complete event listener

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Real progress tracking**: UploadThing SDK doesn't expose real-time progress in the current implementation. Consider upgrading or using XHR for accurate progress.

2. **Thumbnail generation**: Generate video thumbnails client-side before upload using canvas and video element.

3. **Duration extraction**: Read video duration client-side using HTMLVideoElement.

4. **Chunk uploads**: For very large files, implement chunked uploads with resume capability.

5. **Queue persistence**: Save queue to localStorage to survive page refresh.

6. **Bandwidth optimization**: Implement adaptive concurrent limit based on network speed.

7. **Preview modal**: Show video preview before upload confirmation.

8. **Batch metadata**: Allow setting common metadata (tags, category) for entire batch.

### Known Limitations
1. Progress bars are simulated (smooth but not byte-accurate)
2. No pause/resume functionality (only cancel)
3. No upload speed indication
4. No estimated time remaining

## Conclusion

The multi-file upload system provides a professional, robust solution for batch video uploads with comprehensive error handling, progress tracking, and user control. All acceptance criteria have been met and the implementation follows best practices for React, TypeScript, and modern web development.
